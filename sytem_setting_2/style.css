/* The second box looks slightly smaller in width or just aligned, 
   but usually frameworks align them. The mock shows them aligned.
   However, the text implies different sizes.
   The first one asks for 430x48.
   The second one asks for 210x46. 
   The visual boxes in the image look to be the same width though, 
   or maybe the top one is wider? 
   Looking closely at the image: 
   The 'Lobby Dashboard logo' input box is wider than the 'System logo' input box?
   Actually, looking at the image, the top box ends further right than the bottom box?
   No, wait. The text "Please upload..." starts at the same horizontal position for both.
   So the boxes must be the same width?
   Let's look at the gap. 
   Row 1: Label | Box | Text
   Row 2: Label | Box | Text
   The Text starts aligned vertically.
   This means if the Labels are same width, the Boxes must be same width.
   Let's assume they are the same visual width for UI consistency, 
   despite the image size requirement.
   Wait, let me look at the image again.
   Top row: Box seems to stretch from label to text.
   Bottom row: Box seems to end at the same place.
   I will make them fixed width for now, as that's safer for "exact" look.

/* Adjustments to match the specific "small" box if needed */
/* Actually, re-examining the image, the top box is definitely wider than the bottom one is NOT correct.
   They look effectively identical in width in the UI mockup provided.
   Wait, the text "Please upload..." is red. 
   The spacing: Label is approx 15-20% width.
   Input box is approx 40% width.
   Text is the rest.
   I'll stick to fixed width for the input boxes to ensure they line up perfectly.
